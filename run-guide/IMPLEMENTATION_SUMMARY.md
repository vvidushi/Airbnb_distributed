## 🔑 Technology Decisions

### Why GPT-3.5-turbo?
- Smaller model (as requested)
- Fast response times
- Cost-effective
- Good enough for travel recommendations
- Easy to upgrade to GPT-4 if needed

### Why JSON for Favorites?
- Simpler schema (3 tables vs 4)
- No JOIN overhead for small datasets
- Easy to query with MySQL JSON functions
- Perfect for prototype/lab assignment

### Why TailwindCSS?
- Modern utility-first framework
- Fast development
- Responsive out of the box
- Clean, maintainable code

### Why Session-based Auth?
- Required by assignment
- Simpler than JWT for this use case
- Server-side session storage in MySQL
- Easy to implement and secure
